# IPL-DashBoard
This is a IPL DashBoard, this app shows all top stats in IPL history 2007/08 To 2021.
To build this app I have used python library numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and to deploy streamlit, heroku as a server.
I have not used any ipl api, we use only kaggle ipl dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vora1011/ipl-2008-to-2021-all-match-dataset
with the help of this dataset i have applied all analysis like overall IPL history, Season wise IPL analysis, and in a particular Season what is performance of a particular
players.
You can check live demo of this app : https://ipl-dashbord.herokuapp.com/

Thank you!
